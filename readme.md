Four examples of where we're using a 'composite' image to refer to
multiple TMS objects.

How can we connect these images to their depicted objects in TMS?

Ideally, it would be simple to refer to TMS metadata about each of these
images that depict more than a single 'object'.  Whether that's by
creating a record in TMS that comprises multiple objects or a method on
our API that could "merge" metadata for the objects, I'm not quite sure
yet.

| object | accession numbers | image |
| ---  | --- | --- |
| Rice Cultivation | `81.1.1-16` | ![](http://cdn.dx.artsmia.org/thumbs/tn_rice-cultivation-wide.jpg) |
| Tale of Genji | `2013.29.14.1-2` | ![](http://cdn.dx.artsmia.org/thumbs/tn_genji-stacked2.jpg)
| Leda + Ganymede | `78.63.1-2` | ![](http://cdn.dx.artsmia.org/thumbs/tn_mia_33788a.jpg)
| Duluth Living Room | `G320`** | ![](http://cdn.dx.artsmia.org/thumbs/tn_mia_25304a.jpg)

** For the Prindle room, we're using gallery number instead of accession number which is a kludge.
